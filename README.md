2. Execute the JavaScript code to sort and manipulate the Boston data.
3. Or you can access and run the program [here](hhttps://prakashkumarmca23.github.io/wordcount/).

## Future Improvements

- Optimize the sorting algorithm to enhance performance with larger datasets.
- Implement data visualization tools to provide a more intuitive representation of the sorted data.
- Enhance the user interface for improved interaction and user experience.
